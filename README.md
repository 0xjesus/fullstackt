# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

```
## How I solved the problem?

To solve the test I decided to decompose the problem into two elements: The `AppBar` and the movie images. Then I realized that I could handle the third state of the test as a separate component and control the _v model_ via vue events. I also used **vuex** to display the user data. 

To make commits to the repository I used git flow methodology.
